# About
This project is about creating a small HiFi audio system.

We intend to build a two way stereo system (2 boxes with each 2 speakers)
with small measurement (about 20 cm height, 15 cm width and depth).  
The systems purpose is providing good audio quality in smaller rooms. The speakers
can be places on a desk besides the computer screen for example.


# System design
There will be a master and a slave box.

Master box:

- High and middle tone speaker
- 2 x Class D amp, for each speaker
- Switching power supply
- DSP crossover with analog/USB/BT input

Slave Box: Same as master box, but no DSP crossover.  
It should have a two low level analog inputs feeding
the amp directly. The master box provides the signal.

Master box should have a mono stand-alone mode.  

# Technical
Please look in the folders for the system components.

# Contributing
We have some good knowledge on making this real, but of course we don't know anything
and we don't want to spend years making this perfect. So if you want to contribute, feel
free to contact us.
